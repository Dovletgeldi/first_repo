# Small Projects I Built

Welcome to my repository of small projects! This repository is a collection of various small-scale projects I have created. Each project is housed in its own directory and can be explored independently.

## Projects

This repository contains multiple small projects. You can explore each project by navigating into its respective folder. Each folder contains the necessary files, including code, images, and possibly live demo links.

### Features

- **Interactive Demos**: Some projects include live demo links where you can try them out directly in your browser.
- **Project Files**: Each project has its own directory with all the necessary files to run or modify the project.
- **Visuals**: Some projects include images or screenshots to give you an idea of what the project looks like.

## How to Use

1. **Explore**: Navigate into each project's directory to see its contents.
2. **Try It Live**: Look for live demo links to interact with the projects online.
3. **Learn**: Review the code and documentation within each folder to understand how the projects work.
